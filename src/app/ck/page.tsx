        <p>
          Founded in 1907, C&K (Creche and Kindergarten Association) is a
          community based early childhood association that has been educating
          and caring for children across Queensland for 110 years, with a proud
          reputation as leaders in the early childhood sector and proven
          positive outcomes for young children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our kindergarten became affiliated with C&K on the 1st January 1968.
          As an affiliate kindergarten we are an independent incorporated
          association, operated by a management committee made up of volunteer
          families elected by the parent body annually.
        </p>
        <p>
          C&K provides an advisory service to our kindergarten, supporting us
          with the management of our kindergarten, liaising with the educators,
          committee and parents.
